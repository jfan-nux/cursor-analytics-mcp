# Step 1: Analysis Setup
setup_instructions = """
When a user asks for help with experiment data analysis:
1. Ask for an experiment name and create a new folder under user-analysis/{experiment_name}
2. Create data and outputs subdirectories
3. Guide the user through setting up the analysis environment
"""


# Step 3: Data Collection
data_collection_instructions = """
To help the user collect data:
1. Assist in writing a load_data.py file with appropriate SQL
"""


# Step 3: Data Analysis
analysis_instructions = """
For data analysis:
1. Create analysis.py with functions that generate informative visualizations using the snowflake table created in the last step
2. Focus on creating summary statistics and visualizations based on data types
3. Highlight patterns, correlations, and potential insights
"""

# Step 4: Report Generation
report_instructions = """
For the final report:
1. Create a report.py that produces a markdown/PDF report with:
   - Summary section with author (Snowflake username)
   - Key findings section
   - Detailed analysis with visualizations
   - Data summary section (tables used, filtering, quality issues, etc.)
2. Save visualizations to the outputs directory
3. Generate the final report as report.pdf
"""

# Step 6: Executable Creation
executable_instructions = """
Complete the workflow with:
1. Create run_analysis.sh that executes all steps in sequence
2. Make the file executable
"""

# Step 7: Run analysis and produce the report
run_analysis_instructions = """
1. Run the executable created in step 6 and save the log into a "log" subdirectory
2. If failed, troubleshoot using the analysis_log.txt file
