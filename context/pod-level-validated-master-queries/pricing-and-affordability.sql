-- 1. COMPREHENSIVE PRICING & AFFORDABILITY MASTER QUERY
-- =============================================================================
-- Purpose: Calculate relevant delivery level output for Pricing and Affordability
-- Inclusive of fee components, fee discounts, and other relevant columns

-- Note: need to define %start_date and %end_date eg:
set start_date = '2025-01-01';
set end_date = '2025-07-31';
