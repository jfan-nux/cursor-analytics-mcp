# TL;DR

**Background**

*AS a new Cx, I donâ€™t know what promotion I am eligible for.*

- On the second visit of the DoorDash platform for post-1st order New Cx, we have already done the necessary fraud checks to determine eligibility for upcoming New Cx Promotions (like FMX/Adaptive FMX).

- However, we **do not**highlight this upcoming benefit to New Cx on app entry (in an announcement) in a clear and consistent manner across all promotion types.**Solution**Pull from campaign manager to fetch benefits for Cx and surface the matched qualified New Cx promotion on**first app entry after their first order.**|**Control**|**Treatment**|

  </u>

- **MAU rate:** :

- +0.22% relative lift (stat sig), **leading to an estimated +1.5K Q3 2023 Exit MAU, +$364.3K Q3 2023 GMV, +4.7K 12 Month Exit MAU, and + $3.8M GMV per year.**-**Order rate:**- +1.08% relative lift (stat sig)* **Daily conversion rate:**

  - +0.48% relative lift (stat sig)

<u>Check Metrics:
</u>

- Cx app quality latency (See details from Curie [here](https://admin-gateway.doordash.com/decision-systems/experiments/f8a2c32d-f062-4676-87bf-f1d6157e6fe7?analysisId=b55358d6-b9f5-4567-ad4c-faedeea2c925))

  - <mark>No detrimental stat sig impact</mark>

- Cx order quality metrics (See details from Curie [here](https://admin-gateway.doordash.com/decision-systems/experiments/f8a2c32d-f062-4676-87bf-f1d6157e6fe7?analysisId=ec0c95b9-da91-466b-98b5-720a647d9645))

  - Average VP per order drops with stat-sig in the treatment group due to a higher promotion redemption rate.

  - The overall VP impact of the experiment is -$48,188, with 7,323 incremental orders.

<u>Campaign Performance Metrics:
</u>

- **PCIO (In-campaign) : $5.75**-**CPIO (30D) : $7.99**\*50% haircut applies to MAU & GMV given mutual exclusive from other experiments

**Next steps**- We keep a 5% DV level long term holdout group to monitor the long term behaviors.

- We have shown that increasing the awareness of new Cx about the promotions they are eligible for leads to an increasing MAU and Order Rate. As our next steps, we will continue reiterating benefits and savings on the order cart and the processing order screen.
