### TL;DR

**Context:**Cx who are navigated to downloading the app in the App Store currently are navigated to the homepage upon opening the App from an mWeb entry point, rather than the place where they left off.**Opportunity:**Cx who are navigated to downloading the app in the App Store will have context saved when the app opens through Deferred Deep Linking. We hypothesized that Deferred Deep Linking would improve user engagement, drive installations, and enable seamless transitions between web content and mobile apps, by simplifying the user journey but also providing a seamless transition from web content to the app, encouraging more users to install the app and engage with its features.**Design:**|**Logged Out Experience**|**Logged In Experience**|
