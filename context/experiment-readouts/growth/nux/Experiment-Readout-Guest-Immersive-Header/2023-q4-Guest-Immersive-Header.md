# TL;DR

**Background**Every month, we have around 900,000 Cx who land on the DoorDash app using Guest Mode.

Guest Mode provides guests with a taste of DoorDashâ€™s selection, especially when they are not ready to log in or sign up. However, we've learned that when customers log in or sign up, they have a more relevant and personalized experience, making them more likely to place an order.**Solution**An immediate solution to this problem is to introduce a prominent, action-oriented surface at the top of the funnel for Guest Browsers to help provide context on the value of signing up or logging in.**We believe this will improve login and signup rates in the Guest Funnel and lead to increased long-term Monthly Active Users (MAU).**|**Treatment (USA)**|
