### TL;DR

**Opportunity:**Keeping with the NUX goal of having more prominent entry points to login on sections of the Guest Flow that may be leading to higher intent, we hypothesize that increasing prominence of the “Sign in for Saved Addresses” link will directly correlate to increased logins from this pane.**Design:**![Drawing 1](images/image_1.png)*treatment A was the winning treatment
