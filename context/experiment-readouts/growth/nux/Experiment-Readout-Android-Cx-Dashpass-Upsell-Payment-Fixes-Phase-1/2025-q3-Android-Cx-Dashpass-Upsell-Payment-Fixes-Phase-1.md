### TL;DR

# Problem Statement

- Our current DashPass signup experience for New Cx contains 3 main entrypoints:

  - New Cx Signup Upsell

  - Homepage Banner

  - Account Tab Upsell

  - Cart + Checkout Upsells

- Currently, for Android New Cx **who have not setup a payment method,**the Cart and Checkout Upsells**do not currently show.**-*This strongly affects New Cx, as (of course) the bulk of the cohort have not set up payment methods yet.*

# Opportunity

- **Phase 1 (This document):** - Immediately fix the bleeding here by having all New Cx defaulted to GPay as their payment method**specifically**for DP on the Cart and Checkout Upsells**.**This does not affect their default payment method for checkout, but**allows the upsells to show correctly, resolving the immediate problem.**-**Phase 2 (Fast follow, in active development):**- Use the existing infrastructure built by the DP team to allow Cx to signup for a DP trial without a payment method on the Cart and Checkout Upsells (matching the current onboarding flow).**Phase 1****Current Experience:**|**Current Experience**|**Description** |
