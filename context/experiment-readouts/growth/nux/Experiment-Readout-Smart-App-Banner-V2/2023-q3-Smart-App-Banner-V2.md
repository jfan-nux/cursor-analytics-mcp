### TL;DR

**Problem:**We currently have near equivalent visits between mobile and desktop users, with +70% of them browsing as a guest For this customer cohort, we do not surface prominent entry points for logging those users in platform. We are currently utilizing the Native Apple Smart App Banner which is restricted to only Safari.**Solution:**

- Redoing the Native Apple Smart App Banner to

  - Expand to Android/other browsers

  - Have greater design control and interaction behavior

  - Enable opening App Clip (will test into this)

| Currently we are leveraging Apple’s native component | Remove Open App button from the login banner | Maintain both Open App buttons |
