### TL;DR

**Problem:**Currently, the store page on mWeb has limited screen space for browsing items. Especially when ordering online through Google maps, the browsing space is less than half of the screen.**Solution:**To increase the screen space for browsing, we reduced the size of the sticky menu header by removing the menu picker and search when scrolling down. However, in case Cx needs to search for an item, we will show the search bar on scrolling up.
