### TL;DR

**Problem:**Research shows that the #1 issue for New Cx is the perception of affordability. Cx have a hard time finding affordable options in-platform, despite there being an abundance of offers (New Cx promos, Mx Promos, $0 delivery) available to the cohort. DashPass users face the same challenges – they are unclear of the VP of DashPass.**Solution:**Boosting the perception of affordability and reminding users they get $0 delivery will remind DashPass users of the value of DP and incentivize CVR and retention.

We tested this feature last quarter on non-partner DP users in the US only. We saw very[positive results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rRBm1kiFunQaMwEFQQCTog4fjKGKnQTHlbqZ7tPZ7fg/edit#heading=h.wa7bm2c0ccta) and are now rolling it out for partner DP users and international DP users.
