Analytics DRI: Heming Chen

Working team: Vic Zhong (iOS), Varun Kerof (PM) , Zohaib Hassan(EM) + h/t Brian Hale for flagging this friction!

### TL;DR:

When we nudge customers who are viewing carts to add more items (including for DashPass benefits eligibility), we take them to a custom Store Page that does not show them a CTA to “view cart”. This can be confusing to Cx leading them to think that they lost their cart and/or not knowing how to proceed. To improve this we made UX improvements to ensure that a “view Cart” CTA was available to these Cx. The net effect was a **1.21% rel. New Cx lift.**We expect this to**add $78M annualized GMV**based on**+163k new Cx per year.**

**Results Summary**- Estimated annualized GMV:**$78M** ($1.1M in Q4 with 9 weeks effect)

- New Cx:

  - **+1.21% rel. new Cx lift:** -**+163k new Cx per year**-**+2.6M incremental orders** annually on a rolling basis

- Other Metrics

  - Existing Cx CVR was flat

  - Subtotal was flat

  - International impact is not stats sig due to limited data points

**Next step:**- Roll out plans: Ramp to 100% week of 11/8.

### DETAILS:**Problem:**If a Cx has items in Cart and clicks the CTAs that drive them to add more items, they are shown a Store Page without a Cart CTA
