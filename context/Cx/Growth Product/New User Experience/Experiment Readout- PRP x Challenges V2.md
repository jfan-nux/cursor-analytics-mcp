#### TL;DR

In Q3’24 we launched the[Purchaser Retention Program (PRP) x Challenges test V1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gl84Kvq05RnA4fy_yS7mx2ueLsiTVmni2pFDDZRI3wc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.q7uid780uzvw) to identify a more efficient offer structure, as PRP is a Tranche 5 program with no payback. Although the winning group of milestone challenges demonstrated a strong growth lever with better OR and efficient CPIO, the PRP program also showed payback, which contradicted historical PRP test results. This prompted us to initiate a head-to-head V2 test to gather clearer data and understand the underlying reasons.

In Q1'24, we launched the V2 test comparing PRP (30% off 3) with a 28-day milestone challenge (place 3 orders in 4 weeks, get 75% off for 2 orders in the next 2 weeks). The V2 results were consistent with V1, revealing key insights:

- Both the PRP and milestone programs for the SUMA audience are efficient and **will achieve payback.**- The discrepancy in PRP payback compared to historical PRP test was primarily because previous PRP tests included both SUMA and DP users.**Upon breaking down historical PRP performance, the SUMA cohort also showed payback, aligning with our current findings.**-**The milestone program has demonstrated a significantly larger growth lift than the PRP**, with a 6.22% increase compared to a 3.02% increase in the 28-day order rate. Although the milestone challenge incurs higher 56d promotional spending ($2.39 vs. $1.57 per exposure), we believe this additional investment will achieve payback. This is also supported by the milestone cohort in the V1 test, which was already achieving payback within 5 months. Therefore,**we recommend further expanding the milestone program to capitalize on its potential for increased growth with efficient payback.**If we make this program evergreen and replace PRP with the milestone challenge, we anticipate generating an**additional $9.95M in annualized incremental GMV, with an estimated $2.6M in additional annualized spend.**

**Result**##### Milestone challenger performance:
The milestone challenge program shows promising payback potential**with a 28-day CPIO of $3.77 and a 56-day CPIO of $1.46, indicating efficiency and very likely payback.**Revisiting V1 test results, which now have 5 months of data, supports this trend. We've observed consistent improvement in variable profit, nearing zero over time (28d: $-0.40, 56d: $-0.27, 84d: $-0.14, 112d: $-0.06, 140d:**$+0.015**).**Both V1 and V2 results suggest the milestone challenge program is likely to achieve payback**, though a comprehensive analysis is limited by sample size and duration.

The milestone challenge also demonstrates a significant growth lift, **with the 28-day order rate increasing by 6.22% and the 56-day order rate increasing by 5.85%.**This growth is primarily driven by order frequency, which saw an 8.10% lift in the 28-day order frequency and a 7.15% lift in the 56-day order frequency.**PRP**The PRP program exhibits a relatively small growth lift, with only a 3.02% increase in the 28-day order rate and a 2.78% increase in the 56-day order rate, neither of which are statistically significant. This suggests that PRP is more focused on short-term growth (first 2 weeks) rather than long-term gains.**However, the program does show payback within the experiment period,**consistent with our V1 test results, which contradicts historical PRP findings. This prompted us to delve deeper into the historical PRP experiment results.

Initially, the team concluded that the PRP program had poor payback based on an analysis conducted about 1.5 years ago. Following that analysis, approximately a year ago, the team made a change by removing detrimental SUMA customers from the program, which could significantly improve PRP payback. Unfortunately, due to bandwidth issues and the change getting lost in the shuffle, the team did not track the results of this change at that time.**Upon reviewing the historical PRP results in 2024, after the removal of detrimental SUMA customers, we found that the SUMA cohort performed significantly better than the DP cohort, achieving payback within six months. This aligns with our findings from both the milestone V1 and V2 tests.**

**Conclusion**

**In conclusion, both the PRP and milestone programs for the SUMA audience are efficient and will achieve payback. However, the milestone program has demonstrated a significantly larger growth lift than PRP.**Although the milestone challenge incurs higher promotional spending, we believe this additional investment will achieve payback. Therefore,**we recommend further expanding the milestone program to capitalize on its potential for increased growth with efficient payback.**
