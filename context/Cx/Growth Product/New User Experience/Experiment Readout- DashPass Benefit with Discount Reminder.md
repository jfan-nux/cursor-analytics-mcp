### TL;DR

**Problem:**Research shows that the #1 issue for New Cx is the perception of affordability. Cx have a hard time finding affordable options in-platform, despite there being an abundance of offers (New Cx promos, Mx Promos, $0 delivery) available to the cohort. DashPass users face the same challenges – they are unclear of the VP of DashPass.**Solution:**Boosting the perception of affordability and reminding users they get $0 delivery will remind DashPass users of the value of DP and incentivize CVR and retention.
