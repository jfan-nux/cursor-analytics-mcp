### TL;DR

**Problem & opportunity:**<mark>**Signing in and up is deprioritized on the web**</mark><mark>. Customers are prompted to access account entry on the home page (where the focus is actually address entry), or when checking out (when the benefit is low). </mark><mark>**If we add more entry points to sign in or up on web,**</mark><mark>we’d be able to: (1) Provide Cx with accounts with a more personalized experience quickly (2) Allow account creation to happen earlier in the funnel (3) Get better understanding of web usage</mark>**Results Summary**- Estimated annualized GMV:**+$200M**- Estimated MAU:**+183k at 12 month exit** (+155k at the exit of 2022)
